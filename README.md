**Hi guys!

when i was working in a robotics and artificial intelligence competition called [RAINO CUP](https://rainocup.com/en/) , we had some building models that need some lighting for every layer and due to my passion for music and optical stuff , i decided to make a VU Meter for them . most of the vu meters in web use an extra circuit for microphone and leveling the sound but thanks to esp8266 we can do it with less components by using ***udp protocol . now we can make everything musical if it has levels(one time i make a musical servo and its so easy to make)
I think this project is too easy but it can come handy some times and make aweasome stuff.

*REQUIRMENTS

***1.ws2811/ws2812(or anything that have many states

***2.esp8266

(after this videos motions get smoother by make level steps from 1/10 to 1/100 with a little change in codes)
